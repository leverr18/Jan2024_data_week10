Data Bootcamp Week Ten SQLAlchemy
The objective of Homework 10, was meant to demonstrate the ability of using
the python ORM within jupyter notebook, and then based on those queries,
the ability to use Flask to create our own local site.

This challenge was also a throwback to our first jupyter challenges
due to Pandas, and Matplotlib, though I mainly did Pandas graphs.

I used both RAW SQL and the orm to practice both, as knowing both is
important to me. In the queries, we were calculating the precipitation,
temperature, etc of Hawaii within the past year using a sqlite database,
and then displaying them in graphs. One graph was from each reporting
station, looking a bit wonky due to the different data for each day, and
the next was from the most active station, thinking that would give the
most accurate results.
